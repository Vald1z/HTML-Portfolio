    <!-- First Project -->
    
    <h3>Elasto</h3>

    <p><em>Elasto</em> is my second official game project. It's a <strong>top-down survival 
        themed game</strong> where you are supposed to fight the zombies to survive and
        obtain keys. Those keys are used to either open doors, to discover the map,
        or to upgrade your power like speed and strength. The project was made in a total
        of 2 working months, and uploaded to my <strong><a href="https://vald1z.itch.io">Itch IO page</a></strong>.

    <h4>Technologies and Tools Used:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Unity Game Engine: to make the game functions and everything</li>
        <li>Aseprite: to draw the different game assest</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code: to code with intellesence</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h5>Note that I put this in the beginning because it's my biggest and best project.</h5>
    
    <!-- Second Project -->
    
    <h3>Ribbat</h3>
    
    <img src="projects images/ribbat.jpg" alt="a photo for my first project, elasto game"
    type="image/jpg" width="300">
    
    <p>Ribbat is my <strong>first official game</strong>. In this game, you are a rabbit
        trying to find the end line while spending the lowest time possible, typically
        a <em>speedrun game</em>. There is also carrots around the map which will, upon
        catching, decrease the timer by 3s. The game isn't too big yet it took around 
        a full month to finish including the drawing state, that was mainly because
        I didn't have that experience in the Game-Dev world yet. Make sure to try it
        also on my <strong><a href="https://vald1z.itch.io">Itch IO page</a></strong>.

    <!-- Third Project -->
    
    <h3>Cookie Clicker</h3>
    
    <img src="projects images/cookie clicker.jpg" alt="a photo for my first project, elasto game"

    <p>Cookie Clicker is my latest project. And as the name suggests, it's a cookie clicker
        game with some other features that enhance the overall gameplay and fun. This was
        a part of a personal challenge which was to make a fully functional game in less
        than a week, and it was actually, despite of the hundreds of issues I got. I also
        uploaded the game on the same <strong><a href="https://vald1z.itch.io">Itch IO page</a></strong> but also on my new
        <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GzrbyW3QsHgwnE4osanwQ">
            YouTube channel</a></strong>.
