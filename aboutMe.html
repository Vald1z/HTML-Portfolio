    <p>I'm Amen Zaher, a 16-years-old boy in high school. I like the overall concept
        of <em>programming</em> and look forward to be one; for that I'm trying to learn new things
        and dive into various fields of programming to find what suits me best. Lately, 
        I've been testing with the <strong>Game-Dev</strong> field and has been pretty ok with it.
        I'm still going here and there willing to persist on something I both admire and
        feel good about.
